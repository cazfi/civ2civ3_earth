# Civ2Civ3 Earth
"civ2civ3_earth" is a fork of the ruleset civ2civ3 (shipped with freeciv since v2.5), from the same author. It includes new features, tries to improve balance, and is more suitable for playing on Earth maps, or similar scenarios.

This "earth" pack introduces some of the changes planned for future versions of civ2civ3, allowing players to test them before they are available in the next freeciv releases. It includes its own tileset "amplio_earth", and a world map scenario, adapted to be played with these rules.

Tagged versions have been tested and are ready to be played. The latest one is available to install with the "modpack installer" tool shipped with freeciv.

To install manually from github:
* Download the latest pack from the "tags" section.
* Extract to the same folder where "saves" folder is located (where savegames are stored).
In linux it uses to be: /home/username/.freeciv/
* Launch Freeciv, start a new game, select the ruleset civ2civ3_earth, and load the tileset amplio_earth when asked.

The installed files and folders should look like this:
>/.freeciv/2.6/amplio_earth/
/.freeciv/2.6/civ2civ3_earth/
/.freeciv/2.6/scenarios/
/.freeciv/2.6/amplio_earth.tilespec
/.freeciv/2.6/civ2civ3_earth.serv

where /2.6/ should match the Frecciv version that you had installed.

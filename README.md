# Civ2Civ3 Earth
civ2civ3_earth is a fork of the ruleset civ2civ3 (included in freeciv since v2.5). This "earth" pack introduces some of the changes planned for future versions of civ2civ3, allowing players to test them before they are available in the next freeciv version. It also includes a world map scenario, adapted to be played with these rules.

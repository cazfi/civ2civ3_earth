Amplio Earth Tileset for Freeciv v2.6
=====================================

Tileset based on Amplio2, but with small flags, small resources, and colors more similar to Amplio (and to minimap).
Compiled by Bardo and released under GPLv2 license (see each .spec file for detailed credits).

Modded from Amplio2:
- hills (matched amplio colors).
- mountains (matched amplio colors).
- forests from Freeland tileset, with colors from Amplio trees.

Terrains based on Amplio:
- grassland, impassable terrain (with altered perspective), maglev, and ditter effect, from Amplio2.
- hills and mountains use plains as first layer, forests use grassland.
- swamp colors normalized.
- added new resources.

Units:
- added animals.
- alternative gfx for some units from Amplio2XU.

Extras:
- added canals and extra bases (by GriffonSpade).
- gfx for Hospital (by ngunjaca), Ecclesiastical Palace, and Fascism.

forests   (amplio + freeland)
hills     (amplio + amplio2)
mountains (amplio + amplio2)
terrain1  (amplio + amplio2)
